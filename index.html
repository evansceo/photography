        Let's check detailed review of each car:</p>
        <h4>RNGE ROVER SPORTS</h4>
        <p class="sport">
        <img id="range rover sports" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-land-rover-range-rover-supercharged-mmp-1-1595275624.jpg?crop=0.705xw:0.997xh;0.139xw,0&resize=640:*" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="ranger rover v8" >
        </p>
        <P>Plenty of powertrain choices, upscale exterior styling, luxurious interior trappings. Tight third-row passenger space, buggy infotainment system seems, not a fuel-efficient choice. The <strong>/strong>Range Rover Sport</strong> offers a upscale experience plus serious off-road capability, but several of its rivals simply offer more <em>/em>well-rounded packages</em>.</P>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h4>RANGE ROVER VOGUE</h4>
        <p class="vogue">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/Range%20rover%20vogue%201.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="range rover vogue">
        </p>
        <P>The Range Rover Vogue is the entry point of <em>Land Rover’s flagship line-up</em>, but it doesn’t lack any of the superb comfort and refinement of its more expensive siblings. It’s a formidable rival for other luxury SUVs with a price to reflect that. With a host of standard equipment it doesn't feel like an entry-level model, as it shouldn't with a price over £80k, and there's a <strong>real sense of occasion</strong> every time you climb aboard or are lucky enough to be driven by somebody else in one, allowing you to savour the luxurious interior. 
        </P>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h4>RANGE ROVER VELAR</h4>
        <p class="velar">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/Range%20rover%20velar.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="range rover velar">
        </p>
        <P>
        Slick exterior design, plenty of space for cargo, posh cabin. <em>Ho-hum driving experience</em>, sluggish base engine, most desirable options drive the price way up. It's stylish and undeniably high-end, but the Range Rover Velar isn't nearly as good to drive as it looks.

        <h4>LAND ROVER DEFENDER</h4>
        <p>
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/land%20rover%20defender%20.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="land rover defender">
        </p>
        <P>The most capable and connected Land Rover ever turns heads for all the right reasons. A joy to drive on the road, it's also the ultimate go-anywhere vehicle should you stray off the beaten track.</P>
        </p>

        <div>
        <h4>LEXUS V8</h4>
        <p class="lexus">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/Lexus-LX-Exterior-92765.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="lexus v8">
        </p>
        <P>Based on the Toyota Land Cruiser, the Lexus LX 570 is engineered to go where few other SUVs can. At the same time, it provides a thick layer of luxury and refinement for when the adventure calls for pounding the pavement. As the flagship of the Lexus SUV lineup, the three-row LX 570 has an impeccably crafted interior and plenty of standard luxury features. Technologically, the Lexus LX 570 falls well behind rivals. Its infotainment system competes mainly in terms of screen size, and the LX 570's safety technology is basic for this class. Where other luxury SUVs dazzle customers with digital instrumentation, massaging seats, and the latest in advanced driver safety aids, this Lexus falls behind. Amazon Alexa compatibility is new for 2021, but if you're seeking Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or a Wi-Fi hotspot, you'll need a different vehicle. You can take the LX 570 well off the beaten path, and as is expected of a Lexus, it behaves as though every component has been coated in silicone. But on pavement, the truck-like LX 570 is less enjoyable to drive. Check out our full Expert Rating for all of the details.

        <div>
        <h4>LANDCRUISER V9</h4>
        <p class="v9">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/Landcruiser%20v9%201.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="LANDCRUISER V9">
        </p>
        <P>
        Proven off-road capability, strong-enough V-8 powertrain, loaded with standard luxury features. Fuel efficiency is an afterthought, less prestigious than luxury-brand peers, cabin quality doesn't match its price point. The Land Cruiser offers the trappings of a mainstream SUV at a luxury-SUV price, but remains legitimately off-road capable.
        </P>

        <div>
        <h4>JEEP WRANGLER</h4>
        <p class="jeep">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/jeep%20wrangler%20.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="jeep wrangler">
        </p>
        <P>With a pedigree stretching back to World War 2, Jeep knows a thing or two about 4x4s. The latest version of the Wrangler is the best yet, boasting remarkable off-road agility along with much-improved road manners. Available as a two-door or spacious four-door, it's priced from £41,525 and comes with a five-year warranty. 
        </P>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h4>VOLKSWAGEN TOUAREG</h4>
        <p class="volkswagen">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/volkswagen-touareg%20.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="volkswagen touareg">
        </p>
        <P>
        Stylish with a gorgeous, technology-rich interior, the mighty Touareg is safe, boasts serious kerb appeal and is a comfortable cruiser. If you don't need so much space, then its little brother, the Tiguan, is worth considering. Priced from £46,505, the Touareg is a premium quality family car.
        </P>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h4>BMW X5</h4>
        <p class="bmw">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/BMW-X5%20.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="bmw x5">
        </p>
        <P>Three compelling powertrain choices, upscale cabin environs, well-integrated infotainment tech. Steering could feel sharper, snug third-row seat, top turbo-V-8 engine carries a big price tag. The mid-size X5 effortlessly blends luxury, versatility, and performance plus, offers some old-fashioned BMW driving magic.</P>

        <h4>MERCEDES BENZ G CLASS</h4>
        <p class="benz">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/Mercedes-Benz-G-Class-G%20.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="Mercedes-Benz-G-Class-G">
        </p>
        <P>Mercedes-Benz began selling its boxy, utilitarian G-Class in the U.S. market in 2002. Still based on the original military vehicle from the 1970s, it became a cult icon despite (and possibly a little bit because of) its dated, old-school SUV design. Though it looks almost identical to the original, the second-generation G-Class that debuted a few years ago is, with few exceptions, new from the tires up. It seats five people, comes in G 550 and AMG G 63 specification, and has no direct competitors that offer the same blend of purpose-built design, unstoppable off-road capability, and high-end interior materials and technology. For the 2021 G-Class, Mercedes has mainly added some optional cosmetic enhancements, including a range of G manufaktur exclusive paint colors and upholstery choices. The 12.3-inch digital instrumentation is now standard equipment, and the AMG G 63 gains standard wireless smartphone charging. For more details about the flagship SUV from Mercedes-Benz, be sure to see our Expert Rating below for the one-of-a-kind G-wagen.

        <h4>MERCEDES BENZ E CLASS</h4>
        <p class="mercedes">
        <img src="https://github.com/evansceo/photography/blob/master/Benz%20e%20class.jpg?raw=true" style="width:12cm;height:7cm;" alt="mercedes benz e class">
        </p>
        <P>
        Though the fifth-generation E-Class has been on sale since 2017, Mercedes-Benz has done an admirable job making its midsize luxury car feel new at every turn. The 2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class takes these constant updates even further, with a refreshed exterior and a slightly restyled cabin. The headlights and taillights closely resemble those on the smaller A-Class, while the grille is similar to the one on the GLE SUV. Inside, the E-Class gets Mercedes' latest MBUX infotainment system. It's a huge improvement over the older interface. The E-Class also gets a new steering wheel with capacitive touch controls, though the layout is functionally the same as the old one. Also new for the E 450 is a turbocharged inline-six engine paired to a mild hybrid system. It uses an electric motor that provides a bit of extra power when leaving from a stop and is slightly more fuel-efficient than the previous V6. The E-Class' primary competitor has long been the BMW 5 Series. The current 5 Series keeps the pressure on with a wealth of features and a plug-in hybrid variant for those looking for carpool access. The Audi A6, meanwhile, was recently redesigned and counts a high-tech cabin among its many strengths. And buyers looking for something sleek and stylish might want to check out the new Cadillac CT5 sedan or Mercedes' own CLS. The E-Class also offers itself as both a coupe and convertible as well as the new high-riding All-Terrain wagon, all of which receive the same comprehensive updates as the sedan for 2021.
